Jos√© Bayo√°n Santiago Calder√≥n is a research economist in the national economic accounts research group at the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Before joining the federal statistical system, Dr. Santiago Calder√≥n had years of experience in the private sector as a research scientist at various companies. Bayo√°n also held academic appointments with the Biocomplexity Institute and Initiative at the University of Virginia, where he started his career in public service. His research has centered on improving decision-making, emphasizing the public good (e.g., [science policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_policy)). His transdisciplinary research approach has enabled him to routinely collaborate across disciplines and develop a diverse set of domain knowledge and methodological toolset. He also participates in various open-source software communities (e.g., [JuliaLang](https://julialang.org/community)) and civic activism (e.g., [Code4PR](http://code4puertorico.org), [Mentes Puertorrique√±as en Accion](https://en.mentesenaccion.org/)).

üáµüá∑ de pura cepa. I read quite a bit of manga, manhwa & manhua as well as watching anime, donghua and KDramas. Sometimes, I even have time and energy to play some videogames.
