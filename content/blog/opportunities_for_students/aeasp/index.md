# AEASP

The American Economic Association Summer Program (AEASP) is a summer experience for *undergraduate* and *graduate* students from under-represented minority groups in the economics profession (e.g., women, Black, Latinos, Puerto Ricans, LGTBQ+, etc.).

The program offers two tracks: a foundation and an advanced track.

Students take four summer courses in microeconomics, econometrics, mathematical methods, research methods, and a GRE prep course (for those that it applies to). Courses are offered by leading scholars at MSU such as Prof. Jeffrey Wooldridge for the advanced track econometrics course.

Students will work on a research project which teams will be presenting at the AEA Mentoring Pipeline conference at the end of the program.

Activities include a weekly speaker series and excursions such as the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank.
