In this post I will use my personal finance scenario to showcase how to think and make educated choices about how to handle personal finances.

## Income

As a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Virginia I make $70,000 annualy. In addition, as part of my benefits I can consult for up to 20% of my base salary for an additional $14,000.

|   Source   |      Amount     |
|:----------:|:---------------:|
|     UVA    |  $      70,000  |
| Consulting |  $      14,000  |
|  **Total** |**$      84,000**|

## Expenses

|   Category    |   Service   |     Amount     |
|:-------------:|:-----------:|:--------------:|
|     Rent      |  Studio     |  $  1,500.00   |
|   Utilities   |  üí°üö∞üóëÔ∏èüì∫üé∂üß∫ |  $    150.00   |
|   Groceries   |   Food      |  $    500.00   |
|   Car         |    üöó       |  $    365.00   |
| Miscellaneous |             |  $    100.00   |
|               |             |**$  2,615.00** |

### Rent and Utilities

I live in Arlington, VA which is in the Washington D.C. Greater Metro Area in a studio that has a monthly rent of $1,428 and the utilities add up about $150 (i.e., rent, renter's insurance, electricity, water, sewage, garbage, Internet, streaming services). For Internet, XFinity's Performance Pro plan as a new client costs about $45 monthly (buy your own modem). In our family, we have access to Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, Amazon Prime, HBO Max (through AT&T mobile), and Peacock (through XFinity). I am on my mother's phone plan but I bought my iPhone and pay the Apple Care for it ($12).

See the [MIT Living Wage calculator](https://livingwage.mit.edu) by county for a estimate based on household composition.

### Groceries

I have a pretty flexible budget for groceries compared to a typical [Food Plans](https://www.fns.usda.gov/cnpp/usda-food-plans-cost-food-reports-monthly-reports) of about $125 a week. I buy groceries at Whole Foods using the Amazon Visa Rewards card so I get a 5% cash back that helps.

### Car

I own a 2016 Kia Soul which I have back home in Puerto Rico and my mom uses. I have SmartBenefits as a state employee so I have subsidized public transporation.

### Miscellaneous

Miscellaneous expenses may include monthly costs such as health, dental, vision insurances ($40) or every so often like cleaning supplies.

### Annual Leave

In addition to the annual costs of living of about $31,000 I account for about $3,500 more for vacations, travelling, and gifts for a total of $34,500.

## Savings

Every year I maximize my tax advantaged instruments such as the Roth IRA, Roth Solo 401K, and my Health Savings Account (HSA) since I opt for a high-deductable health insurance plan. The supplemental retirement plan (403A) matches half of the 403B contributions for an extra $480. I max my Solo 401k since I make less than the maximum contribution limit. My UVA retirement plan is funded with 5% of my salary and has a contribution match of 8.9% after a vesting period of two years. My employer makes a $1,000 contribution to my HSA account so I max it with $2,500 to reach the $3,500 limit.

|   Instrument   |       Amount      |
|:--------------:|:-----------------:|
|       IRA      | $         3,500   |
|    Roth IRA    | $         6,000   |
| Roth Solo 401K | $        13,010   |
|       HSA      | $         2,500   |
|      403B      | $           960   |

I try to keep my checking account with at least 3 months expenses (e.g., 8,000). Any funds beyond that I transfer to RobinHood or WeBull accounts and invest (buy and hold) the funds in Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (ESG) mutual funds of different exposures.

This year, I am doing LASIK and opted for an FSA as another tax-advantage instrument to help cost health expenditures.

## Taxes

Federal and state taxes: $15,000

## Allocations

With a gross income of $84,000 I pay an effective income tax of 18%. I then save about half of the take-home income. At least 75% of the savings are for retirement in a tax-advantage instrument and the rest are kept in a more liquid form (e.g., stocks that can be sold off and transfered to a checking account in about a week's time). After the vesting period (in 5 months), I gain my employer-contribution match which increases my savings by about 18%. A significant portion of my retirement is also funded through after-tax contributions which also helps.

|           |      Amount     | Allocation |
|:---------:|:---------------:|:----------:|
|   Income  |  $      84,000  |            |
|   Taxes   |  $      15,000  |     18%    |
| After-Tax |  $      69,000  |     82%    |
|           |                 |            |
|  Expenses |  $      34,500  |     50%    |
|  Savings  |  $      34,500  |     50%    |

## Summary

My financial situation allows me to save about $40,000 a year and have a modest living (e.g., expending levels is within a 1% range of the estimated MIT Living Wage for my county 1 adult / 0 children). As I transition to a permanent position, I expect a salary of about a GS-14 ($121,316) which will allow me to start building up to a financial situation that works for an eventual household (e.g., eventually children, owning a house). A $120,000 salary compared to my current income would be about a $1,600 increase in monthly disposable income. I might aim for a $800 increase in spending and a $800 increase in savings. For example, moving from a studio to a 1 bedroom apartment (e.g., $400 extra on rent). Food will likely increase a tad as I might go out more after the pandemic (i.e., I cook all my meals since the pandemic). Depending on the location, I might consider a lease for a car (e.g., $400 price range).
