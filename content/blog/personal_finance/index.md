Sharing some thoughts based on my most recent job transition.

As a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Virginia a potential budget could have been:

Supplemental income opportunities: up to 20% of salary ($14,000.00) per fiscal year. In my experience, I didn't maximized my 403(b) contributions so I could have a higher monthly disposable income (rent alone was about $1.5k).

Starting with the federal government as a ZP-III (3),

### Living Arrangement

I live in Arlington, VA which is in the Washington D.C. Greater Metro Area. I am currently looking for a condo and am aiming to have a monthly payment of 25% of my gross monthly income towards the costs of the mortgage (principal and interests üè†üè¶), property taxes (üí∏), HOA dues (üõóüèãÔ∏èüèäüßñ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è), utilities (üí°üö∞üóëÔ∏èüåêüì∫üé∂üß∫), homeowner insurance, and mortgage insurance. Overall, I have budgeted about 25% of my gross monthly income.

### Groceries

I have a pretty flexible budget for groceries compared to a typical [Food Plans](https://www.fns.usda.gov/cnpp/usda-food-plans-cost-food-reports-monthly-reports) of about $125 a week. I buy groceries at Whole Foods using the Amazon Visa Rewards card so I get a 5% cash back that helps.

### Car

I own a 2016 Kia Soul which I have back home in Puerto Rico and my mom uses. I have SmartBenefits as a federal employee so I have subsidized public transporation.

### Miscellaneous

Miscellaneous expenses may include going out every so often or buying a videogame.

### Annual Leave

I won't have too much savings but allocating about a couple hundred bucks every couple months for when I go on break.

## Savings

Maxing out my tax advantaged instruments including my Roth IRA, Health Savings Account (HSA), and employer sponsored retirement plans ([FERS](https://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/fers-information/)).

|   Instrument   |       Amount      |
|:--------------:|:-----------------:|
|    Roth IRA    | $         6,000   |
|       HSA      | $         3,600   |
|    Roth TSP    | $        19,500   |
|    FERS-FRAE   | $         5,000   |

## Taxes

Federal and state taxes (income, sales and use, property): $34,000

## Allocations

With a gross income of $113,362 I pay an effective tax rate of around 30%. I then save about half of the take-home income. At least 75% of the savings are for retirement in a tax-advantage instrument and the rest are kept in a more liquid form (e.g., stocks that can be sold off and transfered to a checking account in about a week's time).

|           |      Amount     | Allocation |
|:---------:|:---------------:|:----------:|
|   Income  |  $     113,362  |            |
|   Taxes   |  $      34,000  |     30%    |
| After-Tax |  $      79,362  |     70%    |
|           |                 |            |
|  Expenses |  $      45,362  |     57%    |
|  Savings  |  $      34,000  |     43%    |
