A High Performance Computing (HPC) is a supercomputer (i.e., a cluster of many computers/nodes). If you are operating in a HPC, it is likely that you have access to submitting jobs through Slurm: Workload Manager, an open-source job scheduler for Linux and Unix-like kernels, used by many of the world's supercomputers and computer clusters.

Slurm is an open source, fault-tolerant, and highly scalable cluster management and job scheduling system for large and small Linux clusters.
